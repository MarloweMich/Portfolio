          <p>
            Well-rounded web developer with an emphasis on backend
            functionality. Previous fields of work include electrical, book
            binding and kitchen management. Received a certificate in full stack
            development from Georgia Tech Boot Camps in June, 2022. Learned from
            the ground up starting with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript before
            moving onto more comprehensive technologies with their ease-of-life
            features. Always goal oriented and with attention to detail on
            whatever product it is my job to make. A tireless work ethic fed by
            deep satisfaction in a job well done can give anyone the confidence
            of making a good choice by bringing me on their team. Excited to
            bring a myriad of fun and useless tools to the digital space that
            increasingly defines the world we live in.

            <a href="https://marlowemich.github.io/weatherdashboard/"
              ><span class="fancy2">Weather Dashboard</span></a> is a useful tool for
            looking up the weather anywhere in the world and getting an accurate
            picture of the current day's conditions as well as the five days
            afterward. The site site makes use of the OpenWeatherApi and
            Moment.js in order to keep an accurate record of the current time
            and weather. A useful website for planning a trip to the park or for
            those curious to find out just how rainy it is in London. <br />

            effective space to plan out the day with whatever events and todos
            one will inevitably find themselves needing to remember. It uses
            Moment.js to color code all hours in a typical workday to indicate
            whether they are past, currently happening, or yet to be addressed.
            Just fill out the schedule with your morning coffee. Preparation is
            the key to success. <br />
